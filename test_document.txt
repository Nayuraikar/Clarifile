This is a test document for the Clarifile system.

It contains information about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

The main applications of AI include:
1. Natural language processing
2. Computer vision
3. Speech recognition
4. Expert systems
5. Robotics

Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.

This document can be used to test the ask functionality of the Clarifile system.
