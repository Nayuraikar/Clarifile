Personal Journal Entry - January 15, 2024

Today was quite productive. I spent the morning working on my side project - a web application for tracking personal expenses. The React frontend is coming along nicely, and I managed to implement the authentication system using JWT tokens.

Thoughts and Reflections:
- Need to remember to call mom this weekend
- The new coffee shop downtown has excellent espresso
- Feeling motivated about learning machine learning this year
- Should start planning the summer vacation to Europe

Goals for this week:
1. Finish the expense tracker app
2. Read two chapters of "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow
3. Go for a run at least 3 times
4. Organize the home office space
5. Practice guitar for 30 minutes daily

Random thoughts:
The weather has been unusually warm for January. Climate change is really affecting our seasons. I should probably start using my bike more often instead of driving everywhere.

Tomorrow I want to:
- Complete the database schema for the expense app
- Buy groceries (need milk, bread, and vegetables)
- Call the dentist to schedule a cleaning appointment
- Work on that presentation for next week's team meeting

Note to self: Don't forget to backup the project files to the cloud storage. Lost too much work last time when the laptop crashed.

Mood: Optimistic and focused
Energy level: High
Weather: Sunny, 68Â°F
